Requires prerequisites that can be learn broken into sections to better setup you up when you are entering a cloud systems engineer role

First choose which cloud provider platform you want to focus on.

PHASE 1: Linux, Networking, Scripting Language 
  
  Linux resources to learn:

  (read first 11 chapters) - https://nostarch.com/linuxbasicsforhackers
  
  
  Get Cert for Linux-- https://education.oracle.com/oracle-linux-8-advanced-system-administration/pexam_1Z0-106
  (https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/linux-essentials-overview)
  
  Networking resources to learn:
  
 Networking Basics - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IOZ8_cPgu8 (Spend a day watching this and Googling each concept. Read more on each concept on your own.)

 Fundamentals of Networking -  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/network-fundamentals/

 If going Azure path --  [Azure networking services overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/networking/fundamentals/
networking-overview) | You'll learn the fundamental principles of computer networking to prepare you for the Azure admin and developer learning paths. | Optional, but I think it's a great time to introduce yourself to cloud services in the networking category, in this case Azure.
 
 
 Get cert for networking -- [Comptia Network+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network
